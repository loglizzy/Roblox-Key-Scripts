What i know is shit in my code(Ninjutsu... game)
* Code structure, maybe i redo it so its clean and very dynamic
* Naming? kinda started getting ass after a while coding
* Looks like 2020 code because i needed to remove some good code that the minifier wont accept(most wont accept newer luar syntax keywords)

Now some feature issues:
* My code for attacking enemies will always use the "Fist" weapon wich is actly no weapon at all, soon i may add actual weapon support so it have more damage.
* Kill aura targeting for bosses not implemented
* Auto farm & killaura MAY suddenly stop if enabled both

Im not productive at all so any feature/bug may take long so i even want to fix it
